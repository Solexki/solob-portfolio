          I'm Solomon. Yes â€” just like it sounds. <br />
          <br />
          I'm a software developer, but more than that, I'm a builder.
          <br /> This journey didn't start with a degree or a bootcamp â€” it
          started with Wapka back in 2010, when I typed my first "Hello, World!"
          on a feature phone. I didn't even know what I was doing at the time â€”
          I just knew I liked making things work. <br />
          <br />
          By 2013, my love for tech and problem-solving had grown deeper roots.
          <br />
          That year, I had the privilege to work with a company affiliated with
          some of Nigeria's top-tier telecom brands. It was raw, real-world
          experience, and it lit a fire in me that never went out. At some
          point, I took a creative detour â€” I became a graphic designer. <br />A
          seasoned one, if I may say so. I designed banners and flyers that
          still live on my Behance page. It was visual storytelling, and I loved
          it. But the truth is â€” software development was always calling me
          back. In 2023, I finally answered that call fully. <br />
          <br />
          Since then, it's been a whirlwind. I've built everything from simple
          to-do list apps to demo banking systems. I've worked on Telegram-based
          airdrop mining platforms with advanced features, and I've collaborated
          on cross-platform mobile apps with real-world impact. Some were
          personal projects, some professional. All were stepping stones. (Check
          the Projects tab for the juicy stuff.) <br />
          <br />
          This is not the peak â€” not even close. <br />
          I'm on a journey to something bigger, something greater. And if you're
          reading this, you can be part of that story. <br /> Whether it's your
          next product, your next startup, or just an idea waiting to be brought
          to life â€” I can help build it. Because what I offer isn't just code.
          It's care, creativity, and scalable solutions that work. <br />
          <br />I remain your loyal developer,
